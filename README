LibPortage is a fast and portable library offering functionality for doing
package management in a Gentoo system. This includes ebuilds, binpkgs and
managing a portage-compatible configuration. The library will provide all the
functions one may need to write a drop-in replacement for Portage in C.

As a side effect of our effort to implement all portage features, there are
also a few documents we (the developers) wrote for ourselves to cover some of
Gentoo's internals which might be useful for external devs as well.
